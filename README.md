Just run predict.py to start predicting symbols on images in folder /data

Currently supports .bmp .jpg .png pictures as input

Outcome of predictions will be writtent to predictions.txt

To use different models change the name of lables_file and model weights_file in predict.py
if you want to use old models, then use settings from _neural_network.py.
### New models (cnn_weights_balanced.hdf5, cnn_weights_big_new.hdf5, cnn_weights_yuxi.hdf5) use preselected neural_network.py settings

Check whether all requirements are installed
